      <p>I have ability to constantly hacking on things. In MIT I learned human centered design, I practiced a whole process of inquring user needs and making product design and management decision accordingly. Technically, I am a talented and ethusiastic maker in digital and creative industries. I made toy prototypes for toy companies, art installation for galleries, webistes and js animations for companies and individuals.</p>

      <h2>As a UX designer...</h2>
      <div class="second_div">
      <h4>I’m a tech lover</h4>
      <p>As I get to know UX design, I strongly feel my nature matches this job. Data technology makes detailed observation on user behaviour meaningful. In digital products it’s possible to get instant users’ feedback, low cost testing and launch iteration. A design approach based on the dynamic flow of user feedback and usage data would be the key to acquire leads.Transparency of information requires a UX designer systematic thinking to fill up between multiple stakeholders.</p>
      <p>A solution example: I’ve studied Mit multiplayer data simulation App Fish Bank designed to let multiple users learn to collaborate with others, I can study and design such Apps. </p>
      <p>My unique strength in the rising tech industry is that I am a designer with technology learning ability.  When I am writing this biography I am learning on open Stanford CS229 and CS231N-- Machine Learning and Neural Networks for Visual Recognition from scratch. I don’t think many designers can make this decision. My unique fearlessness of technology empowers me to see more design possibilities through the lens of tech innovation. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="second_div">
      <h4>I’m a human lover</h4>
      <p>My good sense in humanity empowers me with good design decisions. Indeed, advances in algorithms and artificial intelligence allow users to "hand all things over to the computer" , letting the backstage to think and make decisions. However, I think it is meaningful to educate end users about decision-making behind the curtain because it can give people the opportunity to learn and think, but this can be done only with a deep understanding of humanity.</p>
      <p>I learned humanity in vast amounts of field trips: I had urban renovation projects for which I talked to more than 30 local residents . I had a cosmetic App project for which I surveyed 50 female respondents.  I’ve learned from my past experience that people are open and sensible in their souls. they are willing to tell a sincere designer subtle and perplexing troubles. Everytime I get what these troubles are I feel motivation to solve them.</p>
